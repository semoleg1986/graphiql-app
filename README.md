The application provides developers with an experience to interact with GraphQL APIs and explore their schemas.

Once authenticated, users are redirected to the GraphiQL page, where they can write and execute GraphQL queries in a fully functional editor. The editor supports syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error checking to enhance the development process. To further enhance the flexibility of GraphQL queries, users can utilize the variables section to define and modify query variables. The headers section allows users to add custom headers to their requests for enhanced authorization or specific API requirements.

There is also a documentation explorer. It provides a way to navigate through the GraphQL schema, discover available queries, mutations, and types, and view detailed information about each field and argument.

To ensure a smooth user experience, the application includes localization support in two languages, allowing users to switch languages seamlessly. The header of the application is sticky, providing easy access to essential navigation elements even during scrolling.
